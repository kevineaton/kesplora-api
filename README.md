# Kesplora - API

A research and training tool experiment. This is the API for the platform. When completed, the vision is that Kesplora is a self-hosted, open source tool to allow researchers to set up and conduct research on their own platform, including surveys, training, and reports. This is not designed as a marketing or product research tool but is intsead specifically geared towards academic research.

This project sprung out of a doctoral research project that had unique needs. Those needs may not be relevant to everyone.

### Code Style

Generally, we use the following casing:

- Filenames are `snake_case` EXCEPT when the tooling requires otherwise (such as Taskfile, etc)
- Variables are `camelCase`
- JSON and ENUMs as `snake_case`
- Structs and functions are either `TitleCase` or `camelCase` depending on visibility
